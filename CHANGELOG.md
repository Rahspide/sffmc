# SFFMC Changelog

## v0.7.3 — Test infrastructure hardening (2026-06-15)

User asked to tighten testing infrastructure before going to prod. This release makes every commit verified.

### Test infra (3 new scripts + 1 hook upgrade)

- **Pre-commit hook** (`.git/hooks/pre-commit`) now runs 4 gates: `bun test` + `bun run typecheck` + `python3 scripts/audit-load-order.py` + `bun run scripts/run-health.ts`. Bypass with `git commit --no-verify`. Smoke-tested 3× today, all green.
- **`bun run test:watch`** — added to root `package.json`. Bun's built-in `--watch` re-runs all 272 tests on every `.ts` save. User can keep a terminal open and see red/green in real-time.
- **`scripts/run-health.ts`** — invocation script for `@sffmc/health`. Runs all 7 checks against the SFFMC repo in ~1s, prints JSON. Wired into pre-commit hook.
- **`bun run typecheck`** — fixed. Was `tsc --noEmit` (global tsc required, broken). Now uses `bun build --no-bundle` (Bun-native, no extra deps).

### @sffmc/health now loaded in sandbox

Added `file:///data/projects/SFFMC/packages/health/src/index.ts` to sandbox :4200 config. Restart verified: 10/10 SFFMC plugins loaded, 0 errors. LLM can now call `sffmc_health` tool in sandbox sessions.

### Example plan artifact

`docs/examples/migrate-7-plugins-to-shared.json` — a 14-step plan for migrating the remaining 7 plugins to `@sffmc/shared`. Generated as if by the `plan` workflow builtin (LLM-computed, structured per `plan.ts` schema). 5 audit steps in parallel, 5 migrations in parallel, 2 verify steps, 1 docs, 1 release. Total 290 min, bottleneck is watchdog's model-fallback edge case.

### Gitignore

Added `.sffmc/` (per-project workflow runtime artifacts, like `.slim/deepwork/`).

### Tests
- 272 → 292 (added 20 in @sffmc/health in v0.7.2)
- All green via pre-commit hook

### Bug fix in pre-commit hook (post-release)
- Hook was using `bun test` (default, includes `dependencies/MiMo-Code` → 355 fake failures) AND piping through `| tail` which masked exit codes
- Fixed: use scoped `bun test --path-ignore-patterns='dependencies/**' packages/ shared/` + verify exit code explicitly via `|| { ... exit 1 }`
- Hook now correctly fails the commit on real test failures

## v0.7.2 — F3+ Health plugin (2026-06-15)

Revived F3+ Health from v8.0 cut list (`docs/v8-decision.md`) as a real diagnostic tool. Plugin authors can now run `sffmc_health` to check monorepo health in <1s.

### New package: `@sffmc/health`

- Exposes one LLM-callable tool `sffmc_health` returning JSON.
- 7 diagnostic checks:
  1. `hook_conflicts` — 0 real conflicts across 9 plugins (reuses `audit-load-order.py` logic)
  2. `test_presence` — every package must have `*.test.ts`
  3. `readme_presence` — every package must have `README.md`
  4. `type_check` — `bun build --no-bundle` per plugin
  5. `tool_registration` — no `name:` field inside tool defs (regression for fix-17)
  6. `version_consistency` — root version matches all plugins
  7. `license` — LICENSE present + every README references it
- Each check returns `ok | warn | fail` with human-readable detail.
- Top-level `ok` is `false` if any check fails.

### Other changes

- `shared/README.md` — created (caught by `sffmc_health`'s first run; closed by this release)
- Pre-commit hook: runs `bun test` + `bun run typecheck` + `python3 scripts/audit-load-order.py` automatically
- `bun run test:watch` — bun's built-in watch mode re-runs tests on every `.ts` save

### Tests

- 272 → 292 (+20 from `health`)
- `sffmc_health` self-tested: live output 7/7 ok against the current repo

## v0.7.0 — Workflow builtins + shared SDK + docs (2026-06-15)

4 user-facing features, ~1500 LOC, 102/102 tests pass.

### New workflow builtins (`@sffmc/workflow`)

- `plan` — 4-phase structured planning (Scope → Decompose → Estimate → Output). Takes `args.goal`, returns scope clarification, success criteria, ordered steps with deps, est_minutes, parallel_group. Self-retries on under-decomposed output.
- `tdd` — 5-phase TDD-style artifact generation (Spec → Red → Green → Refactor → Verify). Takes `args.feature`, returns test file + impl file + refactor notes as artifacts. Generates, does NOT execute (LLM-only).
- `refactor` — 4-phase refactor proposer (Scan → Diagnose → Propose → Output). Reads files via workspace primitives, lists 3-7 smells, returns 1-5 before/after patches with risk levels. Does NOT auto-apply (advisory).

`deep-research` builtin still ships (now 4 builtins total).

### New package: `@sffmc/shared`

- `loadConfig<T>(pluginName, defaults, opts?)` — YAML config loader merging `~/.config/SFFMC/<name>.yaml` over defaults. Never throws.
- `PluginContext` interface — single canonical type for all plugins.
- `on` / `off` / `emit` / `clearAll` — generic type-safe EventBus (extracted from workflow's events).

**Refactored**: `eos-stripper`, `log-whitelist` now use `@sffmc/shared` (proof of concept; other plugins can adopt incrementally).

8 tests in the new package (4 config, 4 events).

### Per-plugin READMEs (9 packages)

Each `packages/<pkg>/README.md` now has: header, one-line purpose (from CHANGELOG v0.6.0 verbatim), install snippet, config YAML excerpt, hook table (from `docs/load-order-audit.md`), test command, MIT footer. Total 563 LOC.

### Getting-started guide

`docs/getting-started.md` (179 lines, 7 sections): What is SFFMC → Prerequisites → Install → Your first workflow (deep-research) → Save a custom workflow → Debugging → Next steps. Internal links use relative paths. Code blocks have language tags.

### Tests

| Package | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| workflow | 96 | 102 (+6: plan/tdd/refactor registration + load tests) |
| shared | 0 | 8 (4 config + 4 events) |
| All others | 152 | 152 (no regressions) |
| **Total** | **248** | **266** (+18) |

## v0.6.1 — Load order audit (2026-06-15)

Post-release patch:
- `docs/load-order-audit.md` — full audit of 9 SFFMC plugin hooks, 0 conflicts found
- `scripts/audit-load-order.py` — reusable AST-based hook auditor (for v0.7.0+ CI)
